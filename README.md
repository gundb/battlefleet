# BattleFleet

It's battleship with a twist - play against four players.

Built for and by the SLC JS Learners group.

Hints:
Open the terminal by hitting alt+t, or by choosing
"New Terminal" under the "+" button on the tab bar.

Get started by going to "server.js" and clicking the "run" button at the top
of Cloud9. This will boot up the server, letting you view the page
by going to "index.html" and clicking "Preview > Preview Running Application".

Before you start editing any code, type "npm run build" in the terminal.
It'll boot up webpack and watch for any changes to your files, making them
browser compatible.

TL;DR:<br>
1.) in server.js, click "Run".<br>
2.) In a terminal, type "npm run build".<br>
3.) Code happily.


Run your tests by typing "npm test" into the terminal.
